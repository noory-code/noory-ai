# Project Identity

## Mission
<!-- What does this project do? One sentence. -->

## Core Values
<!-- 3-5 principles that guide every development decision.
     Examples:
     - "Zero external dependencies"
     - "Type safety everywhere — no any, no unknown"
     - "Test coverage before shipping"
     - "Simple API surface, complex internals are fine"
-->
-

-

## Current Phase
<!-- Where is the project right now? What's the focus?
     Examples:
     - "v1.0 shipped. Stabilizing API and fixing edge cases."
     - "Pre-launch. Building core features only."
     - "Maintenance mode. Bugfixes and dependency updates only."
-->

## Quality Standards
<!-- Hard requirements that must hold at all times.
     Examples:
     - "All tests must pass: npm test"
     - "No TypeScript errors: tsc --noEmit"
     - "Lint clean: ruff check src/"
     - "Bundle size under 50kb"
-->

## Product Direction (optional)
<!-- Where is this heading? What trade-offs matter?
     Evonest uses this to keep improvement proposals aligned with your intent.
     Business-logic personas (Domain Modeler, Product Strategist) only activate
     when this section is filled in — they generate proposals for your review,
     not automatic code changes.

     Examples:
     - "Prioritize simplicity over feature richness. Never add config for config's sake."
     - "Target developer-first audience. CLI UX matters more than GUI."
     - "Open source core, paid hosted version. Keep core lean."
-->

## Ecosystem (optional)
<!-- What tech stack and dependencies does this project use?
     Evonest uses this to watch for relevant dependency updates and security advisories.

     Examples:
     - "TypeScript Node 20 CLI, published to npm"
     - "Python FastAPI service, PostgreSQL 15, deployed on Fly.io"
     - "React Native mobile app with Expo SDK 51"

     Key dependencies (name: what it does):
     - package-name: "its role in this project"

     Only fill this in if you want Evonest to monitor ecosystem changes.
-->

## Boundaries (DO NOT touch)
<!-- Files, directories, or patterns Evonest must never modify.
     Examples:
     - ".evonest/"
     - "migrations/"
     - "config/production.json"
     - "*.generated.ts"
-->
- .evonest/
