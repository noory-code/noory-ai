# Changelog

All notable changes to Plot are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- Multi-canvas split — the sketch is now viewed through three tabs (**Core**, **Actors**, **Services**) so each cognitive layer has its own canvas. The underlying `SketchDoc` stays single-file for v0.2; separate canvas storage arrives in a later release.
- **Core canvas** — drops for Mission, Core Value, Identity, and Identity Facet promote what used to be Inspector text fields into structural child nodes of the Core octagon.
- **Services drill-down** — double-click any non-root service in the Overview to enter its Detail view; a breadcrumb at the top navigates back. `?canvas=services&detail=<id>` makes the view deep-linkable.
- **Canvas-aware stencil** — each tab surfaces only the presets it can accept, and `resolveDropTarget` knows the new core-child / identity-facet parenting rules.
- `CanvasDoc` + `CanvasKind` in `plot_mcp/models.py` with per-canvas-kind validators (core: 1 mission + 1 identity; actors: actor-only; services-overview: top-level only; service-detail: requires service_ref matching canvas_id).
- Expanded `NodeKind`: `mission`, `core_value`, `identity`, `identity_facet`, `actor_ref`. `SketchNode.ref_actor_id` carries the pointer for Actor→Service references.
- 26 new tests in `tests/test_canvas_doc.py`.

### Changed
- `?canvas=` URL param now carries the active tab; refreshing lands back on the same canvas.
- `SketchSidebar.stencilCanvas` prop switches the presets shown in the stencil.

### Notes
- Backward compatible: existing v0.1 `.plot/sketches/{id}.json` files keep loading; legacy untyped nodes default to the Services tab.
- `SketchDoc`'s old `mission` / `core_values` / `identity` text fields on root nodes remain for round-tripping until the v0.1→v0.2 migration script lands.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- Initial release.
- Schema-free sketch store at `.plot/sketches/{id}.json`.
- Starlette HTTP server on port 5190 with 5 endpoints (list / get / create / put / delete) + WebSocket push.
- FastMCP tool surface: `list_sketches`, `get_sketch`, `create_sketch`, `update_sketch`, `delete_sketch`.
- React Flow 11 viewer with full editing: multi-select, copy/paste, undo/redo, auto-layout (dagre), context menu, MiniMap, Controls, resize, color picker, body markdown modal.
- Claude Code plugin manifest + initial skills (`plot-help`, `plot-new-sketch`, `plot-read-sketch`).
